// Used by GRV Proxy to enforce rate limits received from the Ratekeeper.
//
// Between waits, the GrvTransactionRateInfo executes a "release window" starting
// with a call to the startReleaseWindow method. Within this release window, transactions are
// released while canStart returns true. At the end of the release window, the
// endReleaseWindow method is called, and the budget is updated to add or
// remove capacity.
//
// Meanwhile, the desired rate is updated through the setRate method.
//
// Smoothers are used to avoid turbulent throttling behaviour.
